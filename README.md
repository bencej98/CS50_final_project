# CS50_final_project
My first repository for the final project of the Harvard CS50 course

Project name: Financial Tracker

Description and usage:

Throughout this project my aim is to create a webapp that tracks financial changes in a persons life.

To use this app one should register using a username and a password.

After registering or logging in anyone can access all the functionalities such as viewing your current balance(s) at the main page, perform transactions on the transactions tab, planning a budget on budget tab(havent started it yet), viewing past transaction on the reports tab.

// Should add more info later on
